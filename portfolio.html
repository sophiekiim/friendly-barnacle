    <h1>   In this project, we made a cupcake based on the input the user gave. The user is can customize their cupcake based on cupcake flavor, frosting flavor, toppings, and sprinkles.

If a user enters an invalid answer, the program continues and skips that section of the cupcake making. We used the turtle in order to draw multiple shapes and parts of the cupcake.

    <h1>   In this game, the snake is controlled by the arrow keys on the keyboard. For example, if you press the downward arrow, the snake moves down. The point of the game is to try to 
	    get the snake to eat the food (the circles). Each time the snake touches/eats the food, the food relocates and the snake gets faster. The leaderboard at the end tallies up how 
	    much food the user was able to make the snake eat.

    <h1>   Our Christmas E-Card is for the Children's Hospital. It first asks the user to input their name, then, their name shows up on the screen where we wish them good luck to play. For the game, 
	    we instruct the children to press the space bar and deliver the presents to the children on the screen from Santa's sleigh. When a present is delivered, the children relocate.

    <h1>   In this project, the user is able to control our character named "giga" using the arrow keys. The goal is to get past the obstacles by jumping and moving forward. There are 4 stages and each one
	    is different. They appear each time you complete the previous stage and when "giga" touches the right side of the screen. If user wins, it says "You Win", if user falls in pit or hits obstacles, it says "You Lose".

    <h1>   In this PLTW lesson, we had to analyze and compare data in order to decide which region the rover was in. After sorting the data into 4 categories, wind, temperature, sound, and light, 
	   we were able to determine which region the rover was in. Once we compared the graphs to our estimates, we were able to conlcude that the rover was in the Inland Forests because the graphs 
	    show smooth constant temperatures that vary slightly throughout the day, low ambient light during the daytime, constant howl of the wind, occasional thunderstorms, and little to no wind..
  <h1>   4.1.4 Rabbits Grass and Weeds Simulation.</h1>
    <br>
    <img src="rgw.JPG" height="400">
    <h1>   In the 4.1.4 project, we chose the rabbits grass and weeds simulation which simulates a simple ecosystem. We were able to control the amount of weeds, grass, and rabbits in order
	    to find the predator-prey relationships in the ecosystem. The green squares represent grass which acts as the rabbits food, the purple squares represent weeds which kills the rabbits,
	    and the rabbits eat the grasss and die off in the presence of weeds.
