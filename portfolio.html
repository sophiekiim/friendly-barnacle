    <h1>   In this project, we made a cupcake based on the input the user gave. The user is can customize their cupcake based on cupcake flavor, frosting flavor, toppings, and sprinkles.

If a user enters an invalid answer, the program continues and skips that section of the cupcake making. We used the turtle in order to draw multiple shapes and parts of the cupcake.

    <h1>   In this game, the snake is controlled by the arrow keys on the keyboard. For example, if you press the downward arrow, the snake moves down. The point of the game is to try to 
	    get the snake to eat the food (the circles). Each time the snake touches/eats the food, the food relocates and the snake gets faster. The leaderboard at the end tallies up how 
	    much food the user was able to make the snake eat.

	    we instruct the children to press the space bar and deliver the presents to the children on the screen from Santa's sleigh. When a present is delivered, the children relocate.
